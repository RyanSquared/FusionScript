# FusionScript
The programming language of ultimate dankliness

**Warning:** This project is not yet released and possibly has many bugs. If
your code does not compile, it is *very* likely a problem in the compiler
instead of your code. Please feel free to add an issue if any errors arise that
you believe were caused by the compiler.

## Commands

As of 01-12-2016, no commands have any command line flags.

### `fusion-ast`: Compile a file into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

This program will load a file and print out a syntax tree for the file. The
program will generate a syntax error and exit with error code `1` if a file has
a syntax error.

### `fusion`: Run FusionScript files

The `fusion` program (which at the current time is an alias to `fusion-source`)
can load syntaxes from `.fuse` files, compile them, and run them. As of
02-12-2016, compiled syntax trees are **not** cached. In future releases,
either the syntax trees or the compiled Lua output might be cached to allow
faster responsiveness when loading a program.

### `fusion-source`: Run FusionScript with the Lua VM

The `fusion-source` program compiles FusionScript files at runtime and runs
them using the same Lua VM. This means that running `fusion-source` will NOT
produce the same output as `fusionc-source` then running the generated file
with `lua`.  This could leave undesired side effects from `lpeg`, `fusion`,,
and `luafilesystem` libraries. However, the libraries themselves should not
edit the global state and only remain in the `package` table.

There are two command line flags that can be used with the `fusion-source`
program:

**`-m`** - Load the `main` module of the supplied `package` argument and exit.
This is somewhat similar to the Python `-m` flag.

**`--metadata`** - Load the `metadata` module of the supplied `package`
argument and print out the compatible information. Acceptable fields are
documented [here](https://github.com/ChickenNuggers/FusionScript/wiki/Modules).

### `fusionc`: Compile FusionScript

The `fusionc` will use whatever alias is currently in place as the compiler.
Use the documentation for the alias instead of this one to learn more about how
the compiler works. The default compiler as of 01-12-2016 is `fusionc-source`.

### `fusionc-source`: Compile FusionScript to Lua

The `fusionc-source` compiler can take FusionScript files and compile them to
formatted Lua source. Because the compilation is from source to source, some
things may look awkwardly formatted when compiled. As of 01-12-2016, there is
no way to automatically compile FusionScript code to Lua bytecode.

## Examples

### Hello World

```
print("Hello World!\n");
```

### Factorial

```
factorial(n)->
    if (== n 0)
        return 1;
    else
        return (* n factorial((- n 1)));

print(tostring(factorial(5)));
```

### Account (from Lua Demo)

```
-- ::TODO::
 The example in this code example is just for testing
 and will not actually run as of 9/9/2016
 ;

new Account {
    __new(balance = 0)=> {
        @balance = balance;
    }

    deposit(amount)=> {
        @balance = (+ @balance amount);
        return true;
    }

    withdraw(amount)=> {
        if (> amount @balance)
            return false;
        else {
            @balance = (- @balance amount);
            return true;
        }
    }

    balance()=>
        return @balance;
}

bob = Account(500); /* 500  */
bob:deposit(600);   /* 1100 */
bob:withdraw(1000); /* 100  */
assert(bob:withdraw(math.max)); /* errors */
```

### Asynchronous Networking

```
-- ::TODO::
 The example in this code example is just for testing
 and will not actually run as of 9/9/2016
 ;

local {Async} = require("core.async");
local {TCPSocket, TCPServer} = require("core.async.net");

--
 The server MUST be started before the asynchronization
 due to the fact the client can attempt connecting before
 the server is initialized.
 ;

server = TCPServer("localhost", 9999);

new ExampleAsyncApp extends Async {
    client()-> {
        socket = TCPSocket("localhost", 9999);
        socket:send("echo");
        print((== socket:recv(4) "echo"));
        socket:close();
    }

    server()-> {
        local client = server:accept();
        local input = client:recv(1024);
        client:send(input);
        client:close();
        server:close();
    }

    handler(errorMessage)=>
        error(errorMessage);
}

ExampleAsyncApp:run();
```
